Welcome to my blog! This is a sample page. Actual content coming soon.

## Why Start a Blog?

I've always believed in learning in public. Writing helps me:

- **Clarify my thinking** – There's something magical about putting thoughts into words
- **Build a knowledge base** – My future self will thank me
- **Connect with others** – Ideas grow when shared

## What to Expect

On this blog, you'll find posts about:

1. Technology and software development
2. Random musings and observations

## Why Markdown?

Markdown has several advantages:

- **Simplicity** – Write without distractions
- **Portability** – Plain text files that work anywhere
- **Version control** – Easy to track changes with Git
- **No vendor lock-in** – Your content is always yours

## The Tech Stack

This blog is built with:

- **Next.js** – React framework with static site generation
- **Markdown** – Content stored as `.md` files
- **GitHub Pages** – Free static hosting
- **Tailwind CSS** – For styling

## How It Works

Each blog post is a Markdown file with frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: "My Post Title"
date: "2026-01-01"
description: "A brief description"
---

Your content goes here...
```

The site reads these files at build time and generates static HTML pages. Simple and fast!
