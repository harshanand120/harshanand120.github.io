In a world that constantly pushes for more features, more complexity, and more "innovation," I find myself increasingly drawn to simplicity.

## The Complexity Trap

We often fall into the trap of thinking that complex solutions are better. But complexity has costs:

- More things that can break
- Harder to understand and maintain
- Steeper learning curves
- More cognitive overhead

## Simple ≠ Easy

It's important to note that simple doesn't mean easy. In fact, achieving simplicity is often harder than adding complexity. As Blaise Pascal wrote:

## Principles I Follow

1. **Start with the minimum** – Add only what's necessary
2. **Question every addition** – Does this truly add value?
3. **Remove regularly** – Prune what's no longer needed
4. **Embrace constraints** – Limitations breed creativity

## In Practice

This philosophy applies everywhere:

- **Code**: Write less code, not more
- **Design**: Remove elements until it breaks
- **Writing**: Edit ruthlessly
- **Life**: Focus on what matters

The pursuit of simplicity is a lifelong journey. I'm still learning, but each step toward simplicity feels like a step in the right direction.
